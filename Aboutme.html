        My name is Andreza Fonseca and I’m support assistant care worker, 
        I also studied in 2008 Betec level 1 IT skills embedded with Art Media production 
        and Social Policy in Housing participation Leadership manager in 2010. I studied 
        at Hackney community College and Birkbeck University of London. I enjoy using my skills 
        to contribute to the society. I ‘m passionate about Business network and become selfemploy 
        where I have already some experience on that role. Due to the fact of Health issues I become 
        unemployed unable to do what I love. While I ‘m unable to work I decided I applied for this 
        course with purpose of learning new IT skills and updated my knowledge. 
        I spend my free time reading,cooking, walking help my local communities,meditate and workout.
